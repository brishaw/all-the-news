## What is this repo or project?
This web app scrapes a website for chosen content, in this case news articles from The Onion. Users will be able to view the articles as well as leave comments. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## How does it work?
All the News app uses Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape the news from the other site.

1. A user will arrive at the site and press the "scrape" button to scrape content onto the page.

2. The app's page will update with articles the user can read, comment on as well as click the title link to goto the full article page.

3. Comments that the user leaves will be saved in a Mongo Database and can be viewed anytime the site is visited. Users will also have the ability to delete their comments.

## Who will use this repo or project?
**Anyone** who enjoys fake news! The Onion is a real publication, however, the stories are - for the most part - fun fiction.

## What is the goal of this project?
The goal of this project is to create an app using MongoDB, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and Cheerio and then hosting the app on Heroku.
